# Healthcare-Quality-and-Performance-Visualization-Project
Created Tableau dashboards analyzing 4,800+ U.S. hospitals to assess care quality, efficiency, and patient experience. Used maps, KPIs, and filters to compare mortality, readmission, and satisfaction by state and ownership, revealing key regional trends and insights for data-driven healthcare policy.
